# _Peripheral Killing System_

Peripheral Killing System is a Python project designed to eliminate the use of mouse and keyboard by allowing users to control their computer's input functions using hand gestures. The project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to detect and track hand movements, enabling users to interact with their computer in a more intuitive and hands-free manner.

### _Acknowledgements_

_This project is built upon the excellent libraries and resources provided by the open-source community. The following resources were used in the development of the Peripheral Killing System:_

- _OpenCV_
- _MediaPipe_
_Special thanks to the developers and contributors of these libraries._


### _Features_

- _Volume Control: Perform a zoom-in gesture (bringing your thumb and little finger together) to increase the volume and a zoom-out gesture (spreading your thumb and little finger apart) to decrease the volume._
 - _Brightness Control: Similar to volume control, perform a zoom-in gesture to increase brightness and a zoom-out gesture to decrease brightness._
- _Mouse Control: Use your index finger to control the mouse cursor's movement. Perform a left-click by closing your thumb and index finger together._
- _Air Keyboard: Simulate keyboard input using air keyboard gestures. The specific gestures for keyboard input can be implemented based on your requirements._
